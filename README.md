# DistroWatch Data

This repository hosts a JSON file that is generated by parsing [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com) using [distrowatch-parser](https://github.com/jamezrin/distrowatch-parser).

The github action that does the dumps runs every 6 hours, and will never stop getting updated, unless we get banned from DistroWatch...

You can access this file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamezrin/distrowatch-data/master/rankings.json
